Sure! Here's a step-by-step todo list to help you get started with building a basic HTTP proxy as a beginner:

    Setup Environment and Tools:
        Install a programming language and development environment of your choice. Python is a popular choice for network programming due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries.
        Familiarize yourself with basic networking concepts such as sockets, TCP/IP, and HTTP protocol.

DONE

    Create a TCP Server:
        Write code to create a TCP server that listens for incoming connections on a specific port. This server will act as your proxy server.
        Choose a port number (e.g., 8080) on which your proxy server will listen for incoming connections.

DONE

    Accept Client Connections:
        Implement code to accept incoming client connections on the chosen port.
        When a client connects to your proxy server, you'll establish a TCP connection with the client.

DONE

    Receive HTTP Requests from Clients:
        Write code to receive HTTP requests from clients over the established TCP connection.
        Parse the incoming HTTP requests to extract information such as request method, URL, headers, and body.

    Forward Requests to Destination Servers:
        Once you've received an HTTP request from a client, extract the destination server's hostname and port from the request URL.
        Establish a new TCP connection with the destination server on behalf of the client.
        Forward the received HTTP request to the destination server.

    Receive HTTP Responses from Servers:
        After forwarding the HTTP request to the destination server, wait for the server's response.
        Receive the HTTP response from the destination server over the established TCP connection.
        Parse the incoming HTTP response to extract status code, headers, and body.

    Forward Responses to Clients:
        Once you've received the HTTP response from the destination server, forward it back to the original client over the existing TCP connection.
        Ensure that the client receives the response in the correct format and can process it accordingly.

    Handle Error Cases and Exceptions:
        Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with various error cases, such as connection failures, timeouts, or malformed HTTP requests/responses.
        Ensure graceful handling of exceptions to prevent your proxy server from crashing or becoming unresponsive.

    Testing and Debugging:
        Test your HTTP proxy implementation with various web browsers and HTTP clients to ensure that it functions correctly.
        Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix any issues or bugs in your code.

    Documentation and Cleanup:
        Document your HTTP proxy implementation, including its features, usage instructions, and any limitations or known issues.
        Clean up your code, remove unnecessary comments or debug statements, and ensure that it follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
